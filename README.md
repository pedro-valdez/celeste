A new way of looking at the cosmos. [Celeste](https://celeste-eight.vercel.app/) offers a modernized version of NASA's APOD (astronomy picture of the day) website.

Everyday, with few exceptions, since June 16, 1995 NASA has published an astronomy related picture or video accompanied by some text providing further context.
APODs are a great way to learn about the universe and engage in entertraining and thought-provoking ideas.

Though NASA's APOD website is functional, its looks are outdated, so I decided to modernize the website.
However, it is still cool to look at the original website because it servers as a reminder of what websites looked like in the '90s.


## All APODs
I have another [repository](https://github.com/pedro-valdez/all-apods) with a script that stores all APODs up to today as JSON.
I used the locally stored APODs to statically generate more than 10k pages with Next.js in Celeste.
The NASA APOD API responses, to my knowledge, never change, and if they do it is so rare that it is worth to have a repository statically storing resopnses.
