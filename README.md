A new way of looking at the cosmos. [Celeste](https://celeste-eight.vercel.app/) offers a modernized version of NASA's APOD (astronomy picture of the day) website.

Everyday since June 16, 1995 NASA has published an astronomy related picture, video or text accompanied by some text providing further context.
APODs are a great way to learn about the universe and engage in entertraining and thought provoking ideas.

Though NASA's APOD website is functional, its looks are outdated but serve as a reminder of what most websites used to look like in the '90s.


## All APODs
I have another [repository](https://github.com/pedro-valdez/all-apods) with a script that stores all APODs up to today as JSON.
I used the locally stored APODs to statically generate more than 10k pages with Next.js.
The NASA APOD API responses to my knowledge never change, and if they do it is so rare that it is worth it to have a repository statically storing resopnses, I hope someone finds good use for that repository.
