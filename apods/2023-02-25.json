{"copyright":"Fefo Bouvier","date":"2023-02-25","explanation":"On February 22, a young Moon shared the western sky at sunset with bright planets Venus and Jupiter along the ecliptic plane. The beautiful celestial conjunction was visible around planet Earth. But from some locations Jupiter hid for a while, occulted by the crescent lunar disk. The Solar System's ruling gas giant was captured here just before it disappeared behind the Moon's dark edge, seen over the RÃ­o de la Plata at Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay.  In the serene river and skyscape Venus is not so shy, shining brightly closer to the horizon through the fading twilight. Next week Venus and Jupiter will appear even closer in your evening sky.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2302/JupiterOccultationFefoBouvier.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Crescent Moon Occultation","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2302/JupiterOccultationFefoBouvier1024.jpg"}
