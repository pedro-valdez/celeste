Hamilton  Explanation:  This picture in visible light was taken by the  Galileo spacecraft.  Venus is very similar to  Earth in size and mass - and so is sometimes referred to as Earth's sister planet - but Venus has a quite different climate.  Venus' thick clouds and closeness to the  Sun (only  Mercury is closer) make it the hottest planet - much hotter than the Earth. Humans could not survive there, and no life of any sort has ever been found. When  Venus is visible it is usually the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon. More than 20 spacecraft have visited Venus including Venera 9, which landed on the surface, and  Magellan, which used radar to peer through the clouds and make a map of the surface. There are still many things about Venus's unusual atmosphere that astronomers don't understand.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/venus_galileo.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Venus: Earth's Sister Planet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/venus_galileo.gif"}
