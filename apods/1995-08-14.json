{"date":"1995-08-14","explanation":"August 14, 1995    Mercury: Closest Planet to the Sun  Credit: NASA, Mariner 10  Explanation:  This picture was compiled from images taken by the NASA spacecraft Mariner 10 which flew by the planet three times in 1974.  Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, the second hottest planet (Venus gets hotter), and the second smallest planet (Pluto is smaller).  Mercury rotates so slowly that one day there - \"day\" meaning the normal time it takes from sunset to sunset - lasts 176 days on Earth. It is difficult to see  Mercury not because it is dim but because it always appears near the Sun, and is therefore only visible for a short time just after sunset or just before sunrise. Mercury is made of rocky material like Earth. No one knows why Mercury has the magnetic field that it does.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/merc_marin10.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Mercury: Closest Planet to the Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/merc_marin10.gif"}
