Wandering away from the Sun in planet Earth's sky, Mercury will offer good views this month as spring approaches in the northern hemisphere where the ecliptic plane makes a steep angle with the western horizon. But Jupiter will continue sinking lower in the sky after sunset. In fact, the normally elusive Mercury shines well above Jupiter and the orange sunset glow in this serene sky. Captured earlier this week from the island of of Frösön in northern Sweden, the scene looks across Lake Storsjön toward the village of Hallen and distant mountains. Of course, even better views of Mercury can be had by the MESSENGER spacecraft, now orbiting the Solar System's innermost planet!","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1103/GS_20110315_JupMerc.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Mercury and Jupiter at Sunset","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1103/GS_20110315_JupMerc900.jpg"}
