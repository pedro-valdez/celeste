Space shuttles are launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At this date there are four operating space shuttles: Atlantis,  Columbia,  Discovery, and  Endeavour. This  mission is most famous for carrying the  Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. The Hubble Space Telescope is the largest public optical telescope ever to operate in orbit, and because it is above Earth's atmosphere it's photographs are more clear than any ground based telescope. Hubble continues to make fundamental discoveries about planets, stars, galaxies, comets, QSOs, and the universe we live in.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/discovery.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Columbia Waits, Discovery Launches","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/discovery.gif"}
