Made of a rocky core covered by fractured ice, Callisto's past collisions with large meteors are evident as large craters surrounded by concentric rings. The four largest moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto were all discovered by Galileo and Marius in 1610 with early telescopes and are now known as the Galilean satellites.
