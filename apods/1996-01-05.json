Pictured above is the IC 2220 - the Toby Jug Nebula - a reflection nebula surrounding a normal red giant star. Reflection nebulae shine by light reflected from the central star(s). This nebula appears to have been created from the current phase of mass-loss from the central star. Normal gas and dust compose the nebula.  The nebula's peculiar but photogenic \"bi-polar, bi-conical\" shape, however, continue to make it a popular object of study.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/IC2220_aat.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Toby Jug Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/IC2220_aat.gif"}
