This image shows an example of a fairly common type of venusian volcanic feature. Known as a \"tick\" it represents a volcano about 20 miles wide at the summit with ridges and valleys radiating down its sides lending it an insect like appearance. Scientists are particularly interested in exploring the geology of Venus. Because of its similarity with the Earth in size, density, and overall location in the solar system, Venus may offer key insights into the workings of our own planet. Do the familiar processes of volcanism and plate tectonics occur on our sister planet as well as our own? The detailed radar mapping of the planet performed by the Magellan probe has gone a long way toward answering this question.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/venus_tick.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Venusian Tick","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/venus_tick.gif"}
