The above open cluster, M11, contains thousands of stars and is just over three thousand light years distant.  The stars in this cluster all formed together about 150 million years ago. The many bright stars in the cluster appear blue. Open clusters, also called  galactic clusters, contain fewer and younger stars than globular clusters.  Also unlike globular clusters, open clusters are generally confined to the plane of our Galaxy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/m11_aat.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Wild Duck Open Cluster M11","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/m11_aat.gif"}
