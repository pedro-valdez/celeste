Mountains of opaque dust appear near the bottom, while other dark filaments of dust are visible threaded throughout the nebula.  A single massive star visible near the center causes much of the Trifid's glow.  The Trifid, cataloged as M20, is only about 300,000 years old, making it among the youngest emission nebulas known.  The star forming nebula lies about 9,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius). The region pictured here spans about 20 light years.
