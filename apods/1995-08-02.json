Unlike Saturn's bright rings which are composed of chunks of rock and ice, Jupiter's rings appear to consist of fine particles of dust. One possibility is that the dust is produced by impacts with Jupiter's inner moons. This false color image has been computer enhanced. The gas giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all known to have rings.
