The Space Shuttle is the first orbital space vehicle to land on a runway like an airplane.  Space Shuttles sometimes have the option of landing in White Sands, New Mexico or at the  Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The runways the shuttles land on are among the longest in the world. Shuttles that do not land in Florida must generally be strapped to the back of a 747 airplane and flown back.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/atlantis_land.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Atlantis Landing","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/atlantis_land.gif"}
