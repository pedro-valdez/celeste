Above, a standard digital camera captured a particularly active and colorful auroral corona that occurred last week above Alberta, Canada. With a shape reminiscent of a flower, the spectacular aurora had an unusually high degree of detail. The vivid green and purple  auroral colors are caused by high atmospheric oxygen and hydrogen reacting to a burst of incoming electrons.  Many photogenic auroras have been triggered from a solar wind stream that recently passed the Earth. The auroras were unexpected because the initiating Sun has been unusually quiet of late.    Note: An APOD editor will review great space images this Saturday night at Ft. Wilkins, Michigan.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0907/auroracorona_kenwell_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Floral Aurora Corona","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0907/auroracorona_kenwell.jpg"}
