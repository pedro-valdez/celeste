Recorded earlier this month, the starry sky also features bright star Aldebaran below the Pleiades and a small, faint, fuzzy cloud otherwise known as Comet Holmes near picture center at the top of the field. Starry Night Castle might be an appropriate name for the medieval castle ruin in the foreground. But its traditional name is Mörby Castle, found north of Stockholm, near lake Skedviken in Norrtälje, Sweden.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0801/CastleHolmes_heden_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Starry Night Castle","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0801/CastleHolmes_heden_c1.jpg"}
