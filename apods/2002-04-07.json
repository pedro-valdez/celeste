{"date":"2002-04-07","explanation":"In 1787, astronomer William Herschel discovered  NGC 2392.  From the ground, NGC 2392 resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood.  In 2000, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged  NGC 2392.   From space, the nebula displays gas clouds so complex they are not fully understood.   NGC 2392 is clearly a planetary nebula, and the gas seen above composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star only 10,000 years ago.  The inner filaments visible above are being ejected by strong wind of particles from the central star.  The outer disk contains unusual light-year long orange filaments.  NGC 2392 lies about 5000 light-years away and is visible with a small telescope in the constellation of Gemini.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0204/ngc2392_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 2392 from Hubble","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0204/ngc2392_hst.jpg"}
