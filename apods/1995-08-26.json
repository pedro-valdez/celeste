{"date":"1995-08-26","explanation":"August 26, 1995    Two Tails of Comet West  Credit: Observatoire de Haute, Provence, France  Explanation:  Here Comet West is seen showing two enormous tails that wrap around the sky. The ion tale of a comet usually appears more blue and always points away from the Sun. The dust tail trailing the comet's nucleus is the most prominent. Comet West was a visually spectacular comet, reaching its most picturesque in March of 1976. A comet this bright occurs only about once a decade. Comets are really just large dirty snowballs that shed material when they reach the inner solar-system. Many astronomers are hopeful that Comet Hale-Bopp will look as spectacular as this in the spring of 1997.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/comet_west.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Two Tails of Comet West","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/comet_west.gif"}
