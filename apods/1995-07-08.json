{"date":"1995-07-08","explanation":"July 8, 1995   Damage to Apollo 13  Picture Credit: NASA, Crew of Apollo 13 Explanation:  In April of 1970, after an oxygen tank exploded and damaged their service module, the Apollo 13 astronauts were forced to abandon their plans to make the third manned lunar landing. The extent of the damage is revealed in this photo, taken as the crippled module was drifting away - jettisoned prior to their reentry and eventual safe splashdown. An entire panel on the right side of the module is seen to have been blown away and damage to internal structures is apparent.  For more information about the picture see the NASA photo caption.
