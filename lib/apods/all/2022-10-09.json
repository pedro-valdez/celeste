The featured image captured dramatic auroras stretching across a sky near the town of Yellowknife in northern Canada.  The auroras were so bright that they not only inspired awe, but were easily visible on an image exposure of only 1.3 seconds. A video taken concurrently shows the dancing sky lights evolving in real time as tourists, many there just to see auroras, respond with cheers. The conical dwellings on the image right are tipis, while far in the background, near the image center, is the constellation of Orion.  Auroras may increase again over the next few years as our Sun again approaches solar maximum.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2210/aurora_kwon_1500.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Auroras over Northern Canada","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2210/aurora_kwon_960.jpg"}
