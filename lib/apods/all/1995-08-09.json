The main purpose of  this mission was to test a new space based laboratory named  Spacelab 2. Spacelab 2 takes advantage of the effectively weightless conditions in orbit  to carry out experiments in areas such as astronomy, physics, life science, materials science, and atmospheric physics. Challenger and her crew were lost in 1986 when a booster failure resulted in the breakup of the vehicle. Previously, Challenger and her crews flew nine successful Space Shuttle missions and made significant contributions to America's scientific growth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/challenger.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Challenger Launches Spacelab 2","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/challenger.gif"}
