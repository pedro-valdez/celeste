{"date":"1996-08-16","explanation":"The nebula cataloged as NGC 604 is a giant star forming region, 1500 light years across, in the nearby spiral galaxy, M33. Seen here in a snapshot by the Hubble Space Telescope, over 200 newly formed, hot, massive, stars are scattered within a cavern-like, gaseous, interstellar cloud. The stars irradiate the gas with energetic ultraviolet light stripping electrons from atoms and exciting them - producing a characteristic nebular glow. The details of the nebula's structure hold clues to the mysteries of star formation and its effect on the evolution of galaxies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/ngc604_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 604: Giant Stellar Nursery in M33","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/ngc604_hst.gif"}
