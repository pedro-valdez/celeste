This picture shows a portion of a shockwave from this  supernova explosion still expanding past nearby stars. The collision of this gaseous shockwave with a stationary gas cloud has heated the gas causing it to glow in a spectacular array of colors, known as the Cygnus Loop.  This picture was taken with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on board the  Hubble Space Telescope. For more information see the NASA Hubble Space Telescope  press release.
