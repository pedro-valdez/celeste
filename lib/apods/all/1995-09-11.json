{"date":"1995-09-11","explanation":"The fuzzy blobs seen above may be some of the first ever images of entire solar systems forming right before our eyes. This close up of the Orion Nebulae taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows only a few stars, but these stars are surrounded by proto-planetary disks known as \"proplyds.\"  As the stars have only just recently formed - in the past few million years - the disks around them are likely condensing to form planetary systems and may be similar to the disk that formed our own solar system 5 billion years ago. These HST results suggest that stars with planets may be relatively common place. Are there extra-terrestrial civilizations out there as well?","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/proplyds_hst.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Proplyds: Infant Solar Systems","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/proplyds_hst.gif"}
