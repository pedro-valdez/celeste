This orbiting observatory sees the sky in gamma-ray photons - light so blue humans can't see it. These photons are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere from reaching the Earth's surface.  Results from CGRO have shown the entire universe to be a violent and rapidly changing place - when viewed in gamma-rays. Astronomers using CGRO data continue to make monumental discoveries, including  showing that mysterious flashes of gamma-rays are much more powerful than previously imagined,  discovery of a whole new class of QSO, and  discovery of objects so strange that astronomers can't yet figure out what they are.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/gro.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/gro.gif"}
