Although it is very hard to predict how bright a comet will become, Comet Hale-Bopp, named for its discoverers, was spotted farther from the Sun than any previous comet - a good sign that it could become very bright, easily visible to the naked eye. This picture was taken on July 25th 1995, only two days after its discovery. A comet bright enough to see without a telescope occurs only about once a decade. The large coma and long tail of bright comets are so unusual and impressive that they have been considered omens of change by many cultures. A comet does not streak by in few seconds - but it may change its position and structure noticeably from night to night.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/comet_hb1.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Announcing Comet Hale-Bopp","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/comet_hb1.gif"}
