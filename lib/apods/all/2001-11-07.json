In 2000 February near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, two amateur photographers noticed an unusual red column of light rise mysteriously from a setting sun.  During the next few minutes, they were able to capture the pillar and a photogenic sunset on film.  Pictured above, the red column is seen above a serene Lake Tahoe and snow-capped mountains across from Lake Tahoe-Nevada State Park.  The mysterious column, they learned later, is a Sun Pillar, a phenomenon where sunlight reflects off of distant falling ice crystals.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0111/sunpillar_kirkpatrick_big.jpg ","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Sun Pillar in Red and Violet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0111/sunpillar_kirkpatrick.jpg"}
