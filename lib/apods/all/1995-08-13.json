Sol, our sun, is a normal star. It formed about 5 billion years ago, and will last about another 5 billion years.  The sun will never explode, and a solar flare will never destroy the earth. Eventually the sun will become a white dwarf star.  The sun is made of mostly hydrogen and helium.  The sun's center is so hot that when hydrogen nuclei collide, they stick together and release energy - a process called nuclear fusion No one knows why the center of the sun emits so few neutrinos.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/sun_skylab.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Sun Erupts","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/sun_skylab.gif"}
